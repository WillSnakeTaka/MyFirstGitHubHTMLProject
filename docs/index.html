        <h2>Welcome to My Professional Page</h2>
        <p>Hey, curious people:</p>
        <p>Hello! My name is WilliamBuryat U Takahashi, a passionate data science student with a diverse background and a unique blend of interests. I am currently pursuing my journey in data science, eager to explore the potentials of data-driven decision-making and machine learning.</p>
        
        <p>Beyond my academic pursuits, I am a digital artist and a lover of classical music. My hobbies include playing the piano, music compositions, and diving deep into the rich histories and politics of the Steppe regions with a bit of occult.</p>

        <p>Combining my technical skills with my creative passions, I aim to bring a fresh perspective to the field of data science. I believe in the power of data to tell compelling stories and drive meaningful change.</p>

        <p>This is my first GitHub HTML page. Originally, it was intended for the TTP and CTP applications, which I did not succeed with during the winter of 2021, then failed again during 2022-2023, and during 2023-2024 I was on the borderline of being accepted into the CTP program. That was my first year at BK College after a six-year delay in graduating from community colleges and also failed at other senior colleges within 2 years each. The year of 2021 was particularly tough and enigmatic, and even if I had been accepted into either program, I would have struggled to finish.</p>

        <p>Later, I repurposed this site for Professor Lewis' music history class presentation, where I provided a radical interpretation of Franz Liszt. Additionally, it was used for another music history LARPing class, where I Larp as a "musicologist" double agent who infiltrated the Nádasdy family to meddle in the internal affairs of the Esterházy family.</p>

        <p>Initially, I was a music minor. I maneuvered through the college system a bit to use the music major to boost my GPA because of the discriminatory bureaucracy that prevented me from getting into any tech programs. Somehow, I ended up majoring in music composition, which led me through a limbo stage where I developed a new ideology about art, music, and propaganda.</p>

        <p>This website evokes so many nostalgic feelings for me, so I’ve decided not to fix some of the mistakes and to keep it as a museum of memories. I will probably create a slightly improved version with better functionality but will retain the old features.</p>
