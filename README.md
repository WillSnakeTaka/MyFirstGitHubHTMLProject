# My First GITHUB HTML Project
a short html introduction about myself

Hey, curious people: 

This website was originally meant to bait employers. It started as a single-page HTML with a timer for CTP/TTP applications. I am glad I failed both of them for 2 straight years, because BACK THEN WE DIDN'T HAVE [HUSSAM! ðŸ’€](https://github.com/hMRZQ21). Professionalism is overrated. Only pretentious people talk about professionalism dogmatically! I am glad that I have been unprofessional, so that I could meet amazing professors and people such as Prof. Lewis, Prof. Cohen, Prof. Jeryl, Prof. Polina, and many, many more. I started to talk about music when I collaborated with my classmate Chris on the topic of Liszt. These years have been crazy and chaotic. In the end, I appreciate all the unprofessional moments of my life. So, I am thinking about converting this project into a thought museum. I hope you enjoy :) 

This is my first GitHub HTML page. Originally, it was intended for the TTP and CTP applications, which I did not succeed with during the winter of 2021, then failed again during 2022-2023, and during 2023-2024 I was on the borderline of being accepted into the CTP program. That was my first year at BK College after a six-year delay in graduating from community colleges and also failed at other senior colleges within 2 years each. The year of 2021 was particularly tough and enigmatic, and even if I had been accepted into either program, I would have struggled to finish.

Later, I repurposed this site for Professor Lewis' music history class presentation, where I provided a radical interpretation of Franz Liszt. Additionally, it was used for another music history LARPing class, where I Larp as a "musicologist" double agent who infiltrated the NÃ¡dasdy family to meddle in the internal affairs of the EsterhÃ¡zy family.

Initially, I was a music minor. I maneuvered through the college system a bit to use the music major to boost my GPA because of the discriminatory bureaucracy that prevented me from getting into any tech programs. Somehow, I ended up majoring in music composition, which led me through a limbo stage where I developed a new ideology about art, music, and propaganda. This website evokes so many nostalgic feelings for me, so Iâ€™ve decided not to fix some of the mistakes and to keep it as a museum of memories. I will probably create a slightly improved version with better functionality but will retain the old features.
