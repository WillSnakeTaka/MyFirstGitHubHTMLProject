# My First GITHUB HTML Project
a short html introduction about myself

Hey, curious people: 

This is my first GitHub HTML page. Originally, it was intended for the TTP and CTP applications, which I did not succeed with during the winter of 2021, then failed again during 2022-2023, and during 2023-2024 I was on the borderline of being accepted into the CTP program. That was my first year at BK College after a six-year delay in graduating from community colleges and also failed at other senior colleges within 2 years each. The year of 2021 was particularly tough and enigmatic, and even if I had been accepted into either program, I would have struggled to finish.

Later, I repurposed this site for Professor Lewis' music history class presentation, where I provided a radical interpretation of Franz Liszt. Additionally, it was used for another music history LARPing class, where I Larp as a "musicologist" double agent who infiltrated the Nádasdy family to meddle in the internal affairs of the Esterházy family.

Initially, I was a music minor. I maneuvered through the college system a bit to use the music major to boost my GPA because of the discriminatory bureaucracy that prevented me from getting into any tech programs. Somehow, I ended up majoring in music composition, which led me through a limbo stage where I developed a new ideology about art, music, and propaganda. This website evokes so many nostalgic feelings for me, so I’ve decided not to fix some of the mistakes and to keep it as a museum of memories. I will probably create a slightly improved version with better functionality but will retain the old features.
